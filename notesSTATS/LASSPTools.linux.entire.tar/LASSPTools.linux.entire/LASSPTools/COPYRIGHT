The software in these directories has been developed by the Cornell-IBM Joint
Study on Computing for Scientific Research.  The programs are intended to 
be generally useful and modifiable by users.  To this serve this end, we
supply the source code to all of our tools.  The user may modify this code
for his own purposes.  The code and executables may be redistibuted to other
users.  Note that this redistribution may not be done for a fee (other than
a material media charge, if necessary).  Ownership resides with the authors
of the programs.


All of these tools are provided as is, with no express or implied warranty.
These tools should not be used for solving a problem whose incorrect 
solution could result in injury or loss of property.  The Project assumes
no responsibilty for any loss or damage if you do use the programs for 
such purposes.

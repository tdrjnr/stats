The package xplot was written by Arthur Smith while he was at LASSP.
We included it in the LASSPTools distribution (started after he finished)
because it was so useful.  The current version is supported by GNU, but
didn't work on our system.

You can get the other version from GNU: ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.

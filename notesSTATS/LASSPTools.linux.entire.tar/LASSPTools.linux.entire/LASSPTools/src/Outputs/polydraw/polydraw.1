.SH NAME
polydraw - a polygon drawing program


.SH SYNOPSIS

.B polydraw
< 
.I datafile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Polydraw is an X Window System plotting package which reads a series of
polygon specifications from standard input and draws them in color in a window.
Polygons can be drawn continuously into the window with optional clearing of
window when specified, or the polygons can be plotted off-screen and sent to
the screen one-frame-at-a-time as in an animation.
.LP
Polydraw will function on any X11R4 or X11R3 Window server. 

.SH USAGE
To use polydraw, you need a data file with multiple x-y pairs on each line followed
by a color specifications which begins with an arbitrary string and is followed
by three integers representing the red, green and blue components of the color.  
For example a line in the file might read-

0.5 0.5 -0.5 0.5 -0.5 -0.5 0.5 -0.5 rgb 65535 0 0

This line produces a completely red square.

Each "frame" should be separated by a blank line.  This will cause the window
to be cleared in the default mode and will cause the current frame to be
copied to the window (and a new one begun) when polydraw is in the buffering mode.
.LP
If colors are specified they will be used to fill the polygon or draw the frame in
nofill mode.  In line mode they are used to color the lines.  If colors are not
specified ("-nocolors" option) the lines and frames appear in black and the
polygons are filled in white.

Note that when not in binary mode "-nocolors" can be used to produce a black
and white image even when colors are in the input.  But the program will fail
strangely in binary mode if colors are present and "-nocolors" is specified
or vice-versa.
.sp1
Included with polydraw are various filters which allow pseudo-3D-graphics.
These are listed in the "SEE ALSO" section below, and are the same filters
used in conjunction with PlotAtoms.  
See the individual man pages for further information.

.SH OPTIONS
-lines		:	draws lines instead of closed polygons
.LP
-thickness 
.I number 
: Set thickness of lines to 
.I number 
pixels (useful for videotaping)
.LP
-nocolors	:	do not read in colors (gives black&white)

.SH DEFAULTS
There are hard-coded defaults that polydraw uses if no options are specified
on the command line.  The defaults for xmin and ymin are -1.0, while xmax and ymax
default to 1.0  The window is titled "polydraw" by default and the code
draws the polygons as they come in and keeps an offscreen buffer for healing the
window if it is covered and later exposed.

.SH EVENTS
Polydraw handles two types of events.  The first is an expose event, which can
occur and be handled both while drawing and after the end-of-file has been
reached.  Expose events are not handled in the "noheal" mode which is provided
for users that require slightly faster operation.  The second event is a key
press in the window after end-of-file has been reached, where a "q" or "Q"
causes the program to terminate.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp 1
   polydraw -title "Some Squares" -buffer <primary_squares
   
   cat primary_squares | polydraw -noframe

   cat empty_squares | polydraw -nofill

.SH BUGS
.nf
Some examples-
1. In buffer mode with no backing store, an expose event causes the
   the window to heal with the current contents of the buffer which
   is being prepared to become the next frame.
2. Polydraw does not handle resizing of its window.
3. Background and frame colors should be user-specifiable.

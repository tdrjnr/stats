DynamicLattice (v. 3.0)
-----------------------

"DynamicLattice" is an X-windows graphics program to represent 
and animate sites on a two-dimensional square (or rectangular) lattice 
based on their value.  Input is read through standard input (stdin),
and an X-window is opened and animation begun.  Values at lattice
sites can be represented by shaded color or grayscale cells, arrows of
variable length and direction, or bonds of variable length and direction.
Sites can be input and updated one at a time, or the entire lattice
can be updated at each step.  

See the man page (DynamicLattice.man) and the online help via
"DynamicLattice -help" for more details.

lattice2ps (v. 3.0)
-----------------------

"lattice2ps" converts lattice fields of the type animated
by DynamicLattice to (static) Postscript images, in either grayscale
or color.  

See the man page (lattice2ps.man) and the online help via
"lattice2ps -help" for more details.

Type RunDemo to run the demo.

SurfPlot reads a matrix of z values (a sampled surface) from standard input
or from a file and extrapolates the x and y values, printing them out to 
standard out so that a surface plot a la Mathematica can be produced by 
piping to the appropriate programs.  To do that:

	SurfPlot -f filename | RotateStream | 3D-2D | polydraw
	
A binary mode is also available.  See the PlotIt script for usage.

SurfPlot -h[elp] brings up help.  There is also a man page for it.

In the future, the user will be able to change viewpoint while plotting.

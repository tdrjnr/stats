The Linpack routines are all duplicated in the essl library. Thus, the essl

versions, which were written in assembler, will run faster than the Linpack

routines which were written in fortran. Unfortunately, the essl routines

differ slightly from the Linpack routines in functionality. Also the names of

the essl routines are not the same as the names of the Linpack routines. Thus

extensive editing is required before a program, which was originally written to

use Linpack, can successfully use the essl routines instead. Fortunately the 

essl BLAS routines are fuctional equivalents for the fortran versions. As a

result linking to the essl BLAS instead of the fortran compiled version results

in an increase of speed. For examples of programs that use Linpack and the essl

BLAS routines see DeterminantInverse and MatrixSolve.

WARNING:  These are not necessarily the whole libraries for
blas, eispack, fftpack, linpack, or minpack.  They are not necessarily the
most recent releases.  And several of these are now subsumed under
LAPACK, which we haven't rewritten our code to use.  Finally, each CPU
should have a fine-tuned version of the BLAS libraries: compiling the Fortran
code won't provide optimal performance.

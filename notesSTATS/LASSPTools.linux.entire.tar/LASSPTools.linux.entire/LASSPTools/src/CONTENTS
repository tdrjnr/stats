3D-2D
_____
3D-2D is a simple filter for converting lines with triples on them to
lines with pairs on them.  It also allows extra material which occurs
at the end of line to be passed unmodified.


axis
____
Axis with no options takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as 
abscissas and ordinates of a graph.  Successive points are connected by 
straight lines.  The graph is encoded on the standard output for display by 
the plot(1) filters (for example hpgl or tek10).  If the coordinates of a 
point are followed by a nonnumeric string, that string is printed as a label 
beginning on the point.  


branch
______
Branch is a simple datastream splitter.  It takes input from stdin and
splits it into two output streams.  One output stream is sent to the first
command and the other to the second command.  Note that both commands my 
have pipes in them.


circledraw
__________
Circledraw is an X Window System plotting package which reads a series of
circle specifications from standard input and draws them in color in a window.
Circles can be drawn continuously into the window with optional clearing of 
window when specified, or the circles can be plotted off- screen and sent to 
the screen one-frame-at-a-time as in an animation.


ConvertFrames
_____________
ConvertFrames uses the various line_io routines to convert frames of ascii 
triples to and from binary.


ConvertMatrices
_______________
ConvertMatrices uses the various get_matrix and put_matrix routines to 
convert ascii to and from binary, and files to and from pipes.


ConvertVectors
______________
ConvertVectors uses the various get_vector and put_vector routines to 
convert ascii to and from binary, and files to and from pipes.


Det
___
Det is a linear algebra program for calculating determinants.  Det accepts 
matrices from standard input and writes the determinants and inverses to 
standard output.  Det uses the double precision Linpack routines to perform 
its calculations.

DI
__
DI is a linear algebra program for calculating determinants and inverses, or 
both.  DI accepts matrices from standard input and writes the determinants and 
inverses to standard output.  DI uses the double precision Linpack routines 
to perform its calculations.


DynamicLattice
______________
DynamicLattice is an X-windows graphics program to represent sites
on a two-dimensional square (or rectangular) lattice based on their value.
This program is "dynamic" in that sites are typically read individually from
the standard input stream (stdin) and plotted one at a time.  There are
three modes of representation:  shading, arrows and bonds.  The default
mode is shading, whereby sites are filled with a colored cell whose color
represents the value of the plotted field at that site.  In the arrow mode,
an arrow is plotted at the specified site where its angle represents the
value of the field at that site.  In the bond mode, a specified bond is
drawn from a site to a neighboring site.  In both the arrow and bond modes,
the symbol can also be colored to represent another quantity.  If such
information is not given, all arrows/bonds are colored the same.


Eigen
_____
Eigen is a program for calculating eigenvalues, eigenvectors, or both.  Eigen
accepts matrices from standard input and writes the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors to standard output.  Eigen uses the double precision Eispack
routines to perform its calculations.


fit_it
______
Fit_it does non-linear least squares parameter fitting on a data file specified
on the command line.  See also the README in the fit_it src dir.


Fourier
_______
Fourier is a program for calculating fourier transforms or inverse fourier 
transforms.  Fourier accepts data from standard input and writes the results 
to standard output.  Fourier uses the double precision fftpack routines to 
perform its calculations.  Fourier does not need any form of zero padding.


histogram
_________
Histogram reads a list of numbers from the standard input and produces on the 
standard output a file suitable for input to axis or graph to make a histogram.


inter
_____
Inter frees the user from the constrained input file format required by axis, 
and replaces axis's cryptic commands with real words.  The user types commands,
or inter reads them from commandfile.  If you don't want to remember or learn 
the appropriate commands, inter0 asks questions instead of waiting for 
instructions.


Invert
______
Invert is a linear algebra program for calculating inverses.  Invert accepts 
matrices from standard input and writes the inverses to standard output.  
Invert uses the double precision Linpack routines to perform its calculations.


lattice2ps
__________
Lattice2ps is a filter to produce a PostScript file which shades elements on a
two-dimensional square lattice based on their value.  The default  produces
gray-scale shading from white to black based on the range of values input, 
although a restricted range can be specified.  Color PostScript output can 
also be generated.


matrix2X
________
Matrix2X reads a set of matrices from the standard input and produces a 
density plot in an X window.  The matrices are rows of numbers separated by 
newlines and matrices separated by blank lines (double newlines).  The plot 
consists of a series of rectangles mimicking the shape of the input matrix 
which are colored according to the list of colors specified in various 
possible ways.


meter
_____
Meter is a simple analoge style output device.  Its level is controles by the
numbers it reads from stdin and its default range is from 0 to 100.


MMult
_____
MMult is a program for multiplying two matrices A and B in the order AB.
MMult accepts matrices from standard input and writes the product to
standard output.  The matrix A must number of columns as the matrix B has rows.
MMult uses the BLAS routines to perform its calculations.


MSolve
______
MSolve is a program for solving linear equations of the form Ax = B,
where A and B are known and x is unknown.  MSolve accepts matrices from
standard input and writes the solution to standard output.  The matrix A must
be invertable but B can be any matrix that has the same number of rows as the
matrix A has columns.  MSolve uses the double precision Linpack routines 
to perform its calculations.


movieaxis
_________
See axis.  This variant allows multiple, movie style, plots to be generated.


PlotAtoms
_________
PlotAtoms is an X-Windows plotting package which accepts x-y pairs from
standard input and plots these pairs in the form of spheres.  It can also 
produce multiple pictures in the form of a movie.


poly2ps
_______
Poly2ps is filter to produce a PostScript file which draws and shades polygons.
It is designed to read the same input file (ASCII format only) that polydraw
reads.  The default is to convert the specified RGB colors to grayscales.
This conversion is hard to make general.  It will probably need modification 
unless your color scheme is quite simple (e.g., you draw only red, green, 
and blue polygons).  Alternatively, color postscript output can be created.


polydraw
________
Polydraw is an X Window System plotting package which reads a series of
polygon specifications from standard input and draws them in color in a window.
Polygons can be drawn continuously into the window with optional clearing of
window when specified, or the polygons can be plotted off-screen and sent to
the screen one frame at a time as in an animation.


polydraw3D
__________
Polydraw3D is an X Window System like polydraw but reads in one frame polygons
in 3D coordiantes and can rotate and do a simulated perspective of that frame.

triples only from a file.


RotateStream
____________

widgets, and allows the user to set values within user specified ranges.


sortit
______

and sorts each block in terms of the value of the third column of the
input, in increasing order.

material which occurs at the end of line to be passed unmodified.


xplot
_____
The xplot program brings up a window for viewing plot(5) output, for example
from the axis program.  The program works interactively, continuing to
accept input from stdin and plotting as it goes, until it reaches
an end of file, at which point it waits around for a mouse button
press to kill the window.


xyMoviePlot
___________

simple animations.


XYinput
_______

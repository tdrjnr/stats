     INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
     execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
     description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
     
	INFO = 0  improper input parameters.
    
        INFO = 1  algorithm estimates that the relative error in the
              sum of squares is at most TOL.
    
        INFO = 2  algorithm estimates that the relative error between
                  X and the solution is at most TOL.

        INFO = 3  conditions for INFO = 1 and INFO = 2 both hold.

        INFO = 4  FVEC is orthogonal to the columns of the Jacobian to
                  machine precision.

        INFO = 5  number of calls to FCN has reached 100*(N+1)
                  for IOPT=2 or 3 or 200*(N+1) for IOPT=1.

        INFO = 6  TOL is too small.  No further reduction in the sum
                  of squares is possible.

        INFO = 7  TOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
                  approximate solution X is possible.

4. Successful Completion.

      The accuracy of DNLS1E is controlled by the convergence parame-
      ter TOL.  This parameter is used in tests which make three types
      of comparisons between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.
      DNLS1E terminates when any of the tests is satisfied.  If TOL is
      less than the machine precision (as defined by the function
      R1MACH(4)), then DNLS1E only attempts to satisfy the test
      defined by the machine precision.  Further progress is not usu-
      ally possible.  Unless high precision solutions are required,
      the recommended value for TOL is the square root of the machine
      precision.

      The tests assume that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
      and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
      and the Jacobian are coded consistently.  If these conditions
      are not satisfied, then DNLS1E may incorrectly indicate conver-
      gence.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=1,
      then the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
      rerunning DNLS1E with tighter tolerances.

      First Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm
        of a vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that

              ENORM(FVEC) .LE. (1+TOL)*ENORM(FVECS),

        where FVECS denotes the functions evaluated at XSOL.  If this
        condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the final
        residual norm ENORM(FVEC) has K significant decimal digits and
        INFO is set to 1 (or to 3 if the second test is also satis-
        fied).

      Second Convergence Test.  If D is a diagonal matrix (implicitly
        generated by DNLS1E) whose entries contain scale factors for
        the variables, then this test attempts to guarantee that

              ENORM(D*(X-XSOL)) .LE.  TOL*ENORM(D*XSOL).

        If this condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the
        larger components of D*X have K significant decimal digits and
        INFO is set to 2 (or to 3 if the first test is also satis-
        fied).  There is a danger that the smaller components of D*X
        may have large relative errors, but the choice of D is such
        that the accuracy of the components of X is usually related to
        their sensitivity.

      Third Convergence Test.  This test is satisfied when FVEC is
        orthogonal to the columns of the Jacobian to machine preci-
        sion.  There is no clear relationship between this test and
        the accuracy of DNLS1E, and furthermore, the test is equally
        well satisfied at other critical points, namely maximizers and
        saddle points.  Therefore, termination caused by this test
        (INFO = 4) should be examined carefully.


5. Unsuccessful Completion.

      Unsuccessful termination of DNLS1E can be due to improper input
      parameters, Arithmetic interrupts, or an excessive number of
      function evaluations.

      Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT .LT. 1
        or IOPT .GT. 3, or N .LE. 0, or M .LT. N, or TOL .LT. 0.E0,
        or for IOPT=1 or 2 LWA .LT. N*(M+5)+M, or for IOPT=3
        LWA .LT. N*(N+5)+M.

      Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
        subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
        be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by DNLS1E.  In this
        case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by not evalu-
        ating the functions here, but instead setting the components
        of FVEC to numbers that exceed those in the initial FVEC.

      Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  If the number of
        calls to FCN reaches 100*(N+1) for IOPT=2 or 3 or 200*(N+1)
        for IOPT=1, then this indicates that the routine is converging
        very slowly as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is
        set to 5.  In this case, it may be helpful to restart DNLS1E,
        thereby forcing it to disregard old (and possibly harmful)
        information.

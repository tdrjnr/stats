inter is an interactive front end for the 2d graphing program, axis.

To compile inter, follow the instructions at the beginning of the Makefile.

Sample aliases that can make your life easier are in the file "aliases".

inter is copyright by me, Stephen A. Langer, 1988-1993. You may freely
redistribute it, as long as this copyright notice is preserved. If you
make major modifications, please send them to me at langer@sfu.ca. 



HELPDIR in the Makefile, unfortunately, has to be set by hand to the
path leading to this directory.

Doesn't compile under Linux.

Version 3.2.7
-- Fixed inconsistencies between inter's and axis's line styles, finally.

Version 3.2.6
-- Now using getopt() to parse arguments.
-- Added -e option.
-- Added "option duplicate".
-- Changed "include" to "include file", and added "include next".
-- Added "histogram baseline" and made default NOT to draw baseline.

Version 3.2.5
-- Fixed possible segmentation faults when appending files of different lengths.
-- Put startup message in code, rather than in a separate file, so it can't
   get lost when people transfer the executable.

Version 3.2.4

-- Added "append" commands, -a option, and fixed a few core dumps when
   bad column numbers were given.
-- Fixed default column numbers in data modification routines when ncols=1.
-- Got rid of lines for empty bins in logarithmic histograms.
-- Added "forget" command to discard data. Useful when reading many large files.
-- Added "histogram auto".
-- Added "filter tbird".
-- Fixed bug in 2nd invocation of "hist weight".

Version 3.2.3

-- Avoided core dump when using applyfunc() on nonexistent columns.
-- histogram understands x,*,$, and works in moviemode.

Version 3.2.2

-- Added "option moviemode". When moviemode is on, the screen is cleared and
   axes redrawn for each curve.

Version 3.2.1:

-- New command line options, allowing for different ways of reading the first
   input file.
      -i --- DON'T ignore axis commands in input.
      -f --- specify a filter to read input.

-- Fixed a bug in transmission of axis commands.

Version 3.2 and earlier:

 -- New commands "filter set", "filter clear", "filter show" to let you
    preprocess data files. Ie, if you have data files that you would like
    to run through another program, instead of doing
           otherprogram < data.file > temp.file
           inter temp.file | axis ...
    you can do
           inter | axis ...
           inter >> filter set otherprogram
           inter >> file data.file
    and you never have to create a temp.file. As usual, this may be only
    useful to me, but that's why I add features, mostly.

-- The long help file (what you get when you just type "help") is run
   through "more", so you don't have to read the whole thing (you can
   use "q" to quit from "more"). At some point I'll make the help file
   complete, describing all the commands.

-- Some bugs were fixed that could cause inter to bomb sometimes.

-- Labels can be enclosed in quotation marks ("), which will be stripped
   off before the labels are used. This allows labels to begin with
   spaces, which was not possible before, and give you some more control
   over where they appear.

-- New command "repeat" reexecutes the previous command line. If you
   invoke inter with a long list of files and want to do the same thing
   to each of them, you can type, for example,
      inter >> option (shift 1; scale 3; adjust *) p *; next
      inter >> repeat
      inter >> repeat
      etc.

-- New command "option invert" to compute (data)^{-1}

-- New commands "option range [x or y] [max or min]" to set the range
   of data points to be included. This is different from the setting the
   limits on the plot. Points outside the range are not sent to axis.
   For example, if you want to take the log of an x data set that isn't
   positive everywhere, you can use "option range x min 0" to exclude
   all but the positive x values. The ranges do not include their endpoints.

-- You can specify columns in the input file as "x", "*" (all but x),
   or "$" (last column). For example, you can type "plot *" to plot all
   the data. This feature doesn't work in every command, but it works
   where it's most useful.
